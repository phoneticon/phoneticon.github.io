            <p>The aim is of this development plan to build a prototype interface for <strong>Phoneticon</strong>; a new
                platform for next-generation digital communication. The prototype interface will feature sufficient
                functionalities to give the users a taste of creating <i>audiovisual texts</i>, or, <i>phoneticons</i>.
                The main purpose of Phoneticon is to provide a new way of text messaging on digital devices, where the
                expressivity of the textual content is expanded beyond the choice of font types; to the mediums of
                audiovisual and motion graphics.</p>
            <p>By expanding the expressivity of the digital text, the users will be able to create and send messages
                that
                convey more complex meanings; by adding emotional contents to the text. The current text messaging
                platforms have incorporated emojis, GIFs and other visually oriented elements, as well as, audio
                messaging to expand the user's ability to express beyond the limitations of text. Phoneticon approaches
                the limitations of written language to carry emotional contents by adding audiovisual and motion
                graphical elements to the text.</p>
            <p>By using Phoneticon as a medium for communication, we believe that the users will be able to develop and
                enhance their creativity, sensibility and empathy. When creating a phoneticon, it requires the users to
                visually format, sonically shape, and, control the motion of the text message based on the users’
                conceptual and emotional content. This requires the users’ ability to <i>think</i> creatively,
                <i>feel</i> for sensibility of aesthetics, and <i>intuit</i> empathetically the emotions that the users
                want to convey.</p>
