        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <article>
            <p>The aim is of this development plan to build a prototype interface for <strong>Phoneticon</strong>; a new
                platform for next-generation digital communication. The prototype interface will feature sufficient
                functionalities to give the user a taste of creating <i>audiovisual texts</i>, or, <i>phoneticons</i>.
                The main purpose of Phoneticon is to provide a new platform for text messeging on digital devices, where
                the expression of the textual content is expanded beyond the choice of font types; to the mediums of
                audio, and, visual & motion graphics.
            </p>
            <p>By expanding the expressibility of the digital text, the user will be able to create and send messeges
                that convey more complex meanings by adding emotional contents to the text. The current text messeging
                platforms have incorporated emojis, GIFs and other visually oriented elements, as well as, audio
                messeging to expand the user's ability to express all that which cannot be expressed solely by words.
                Phoneticon approaches the limitations of written language to carry emotional contents by adding
                audiovisual and motive elements to the text.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using Phoneticon as a medium for communication, we believe that the users will be able
                to develop and enhance their creativity, sensibility and empathy. When creating a phoneticon, it
                requires the user to <i>think</i> and <i>feel</i> about how to visually format, sonically shape and set
                the motion of the textual content based on the user's conceptual and emotional messege. This requires
                the user's ability to think creatively, feel for sensibility of aesethetics, and intuit empathetically
                the emotions that the user wants to convey.
